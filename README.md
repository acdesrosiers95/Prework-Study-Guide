## Usage

This Prework study guide is designed to be a quick reference into the building blocks of coding with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section has key notes/terms about certain topics, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to help with understanding what they mean and how they pertain coding. If you open the Devtools console, we can see JavaScript running it. It list the key topics we focused on from the prework and can choose one of the topics for us to focus on first. The Devtools can be opened by pressing Command+Options+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel will open to either the left or bottom of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
